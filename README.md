# Concurrent Ticket Booking System with Seat Locking and Confirmation

This project is a simple **ticket booking system** built with **Node.js** and **Express.js**, featuring a front-end UI to view, lock, and confirm seat bookings in real-time. It simulates a seat reservation system that handles concurrency by implementing seat locking and automatic lock expiration.

---

## Features

- View seat availability status in real-time.
- Lock seats to temporarily reserve them (lock expires after 1 minute).
- Confirm locked seats to finalize the booking.
- Prevent double booking through seat locking.
- User-friendly browser interface with clear color-coded seat statuses:
  - **Green**: Available
  - **Blue**: Locked
  - **Gray**: Booked
